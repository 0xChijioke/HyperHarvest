# XMTP Integration

We use XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) to keep users informed about their investments:

1. Users can opt-in to receive notifications in the Converse app.
2. We send notifications for key events:
   * Deposits and withdrawals
   * Significant yield changes
   * Cross-chain fund transfers

This transparent communication helps build trust with our users, even though the underlying strategy is private.
