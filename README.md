## üìÄ Optimized Yield Aggregation 
Our yield aggregator implements several strategies to maximize returns for users:

- Multi-chain Yield Comparison: Continuously monitors yield rates across supported chains.
- Dynamic Rebalancing: Automatically moves funds between chains to capture the highest yield opportunities.
- Gas-Optimized Transfers: Utilizes Chainlink's CCIP for efficient and secure cross-chain operations.
- Risk Management: Diversifies funds across multiple chains to mitigate potential risks.

## üü¶ Chainlink CCIP Integration

### Overview
Our project utilizes Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enable seamless transfer of USDC funds between different blockchain networks. The HyperHarvest contract serves as both a vault and a gateway for receiving CCIP messages and funds.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Fund Transfer**: Ability to move USDC funds between different blockchain networks.
- **Integrated Vault Functionality**: HyperHarvest contract acts as a vault for storing user funds.
- **CCIP Message Handling**: Built-in capability to process incoming CCIP messages and funds.

### Technical Implementation
#### CCIP Router Integration
The contract inherits from CCIPReceiver, which provides the necessary functionality to interact with the CCIP router:
```
contract HyperHarvest is ERC4626, CCIPReceiver, ReentrancyGuard {
    // ...
}
```
#### Cross-Chain Asset Transfer
The bridgeAndSupplyAssetToAave function prepares and sends CCIP messages to transfer assets:
```
function bridgeAndSupplyAssetToAave(
    address _receiver,
    uint256 _gasFeeAmount,
    uint64 _destinationChainSelector
) public onlyAllowed(msg.sender) returns (bytes32 messageId) {
    // ... (Function implementation)
}
```
#### CCIP Message Reception
The _ccipReceive function handles incoming CCIP messages:
```
function _ccipReceive(
    Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message
) internal override nonReentrant {
    // ... (Function implementation)
}
```
### Benefits

- **Interoperability**: Enables seamless movement of funds across different blockchain networks.
- **Enhanced Yield Opportunities**: Allows users to access yield opportunities on multiple chains.
- **Automated Cross-Chain Operations**: Facilitates automated fund transfers and yield farming across chains.

## üî• Lit Protocol Integration

### Overview
Our project leverages Lit Protocol to implement private strategies for our cross-chain yield aggregator. This integration allows us to compute over private data, determining optimal fund allocation across different chains while maintaining strategy confidentiality.

### Key Features

- **Private Strategy Computation**: We use Lit Actions to decrypt and compute private strategies.
- **Cross-Chain Yield Optimization**: The system determines the best chain for fund allocation based on current yields and transfer costs.
- **Automated Decision Making**: Our Lit Action script runs periodically to make informed decisions about fund transfers.

### Use Case
We have implemented Lit Protocol for the following purpose:

Strategy Decryption and Execution: 
Decrypt private strategies within Lit Actions and perform computations within lit actions based on the current market yield data on both chains , gas fees required for fund transfers and decrypted strategy parameters.

### Benefits

- **Competitive Advantage**: Private strategies give us an edge over other yield aggregators.
- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive strategy data remains encrypted and is only decrypted within secure Lit Actions.
- **Optimized Yields**: Regular computations ensure users always get the best possible yields.
- **User Experience**: Automated decision-making provides a seamless experience for users.

### Technical Implementation

#### Lit Action Implementation
Our Strategy Executor script performs the following tasks:

- Decrypts the Encrypted private strategy data within the lit action .
- Computes current yields on different chains (e.g., Optimism Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia).
- Calculates total transfer costs, including CCIP and network fees.
- Lit action determines if a fund transfer would result in higher yields for users based on the decrypted strategy .
- Lit action returns the target chain and a boolean indicating whether to move funds.
- Funds get transferred from one chain to other if required according to the result returned by the Lit action.

We have implemented a simple strategy for HyperHarvest but as the number of chains and number of protocol integrations increase the complexity of the strategy would increase significantly and the exclusiveness of the strategy would give us huge competitive advantage while keeping the users aware of the events happening inside HyperHarvest using XMTP notifications for different events such as fund transfers, deposits, withdrawals etc.

The script runs every 4 hours to ensure timely decision-making and highest yield possible .

### Integration with CCIP
Based on the Lit Action's response, we use Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to transfer funds between chains when beneficial.

This integration works hand-in-hand with our XMTP implementation to create a responsive, informative, and user-friendly application that keeps users updated on critical changes and events in real-time.



## üï∏Ô∏è Web3Auth MPC Core Kit Integration

Our dApp integrates the Web3Auth [Web3Auth MPC Core Kit SDK](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/helpers/web3Auth.ts#L9) to simplify non-custodial wallet creation, streamlining the onboarding process. With [Google Sign-In](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/context/Web3Context.tsx#L99) and [custom JWT authentication](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/context/Web3Context.tsx#L111), users can connect using existing credentials, eliminating the complexities of web3 interaction. This allows them to seamlessly perform key actions such as [deposits](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/components/hyperharvest/Harvest.tsx#L70) and [withdrawals](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/components/hyperharvest/Harvest.tsx#L88).

### Key Features:

- [**Custom Google Authentication**](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/context/Web3Context.tsx#L99): Users log in with their Google accounts, and wallet creation happens automatically in the background using Web3Auth MPC-TSS. No additional setup is required.
- [**Flexible JWT Flow**](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/context/Web3Context.tsx#L111): Users can authenticate using either Google or Farcaster (pending full integration), with the option to switch between them, enhancing security and control.
- **Automatic Wallet Generation**: Web3 wallets are generated during the login process, giving users immediate access to features like token transfers without additional steps.
Core Technical Execution:
- [**MPC-TSS Integration**](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/helpers/web3Auth.ts#L9): We leverage Multi-Party Computation Threshold Signature Scheme (MPC-TSS) for secure key management, completely abstracted from the user.
- [**Smart Contract Interaction**](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/utils/contract.ts#L11): Users can perform transactions, like deposits or withdrawals, by interacting with AAVE and Chainlink-powered vaults using Web3Auth-generated wallets. This includes on-chain actions on Arbitrum and Optimism.
- [**Persistent User Sessions**]()https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/context/Web3Context.tsx#L53: Using JWTs, we enable continuous user sessions, reducing the need for repeated logins. Data is locally stored for a smooth experience during future logins.

### How It Works:

- Login: Users sign in with Google, triggering a custom JWT process via Web3Auth MPC Core Kit SDK.
- Wallets are automatically created during login.
- Transactions: Users can make deposits or withdrawals via their Web3Auth-generated wallet without dealing with gas fees or blockchain intricacies.
- On-Chain: Transactions like depositing USDC into vaults are facilitated via smart contracts on Arbitrum and Optimism.

### Limitations:

- Farcaster Login: The Farcaster login flow is partially integrated and remains incomplete.
- [MFA Sharing](https://github.com/ETHarvest/HyperHarvest/blob/main/packages/nextjs/app/settings/page.tsx#L38): While MFA is enabled, the ability for users to share or export their MFA factor key is not yet available.

### Future Improvements:

- Complete the Farcaster login integration.
- Add functionality for users to share or export their MFA factor key across devices.
- Ensure seamless chain switching in the frontend to allow users to switch between Arbitrum and Optimism effortlessly.
