# Web3 Auth Integration

To make our platform accessible to a wider audience, we've integrated Web3Auth:

1. Users can log in using their Google, Farcaster, or other social accounts.
2. Web3Auth creates a non-custodial smart contract wallet for the user.
3. Users can then interact with our platform (deposit, withdraw) without needing to manage private keys or install a separate wallet.

This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for non-crypto native users.
