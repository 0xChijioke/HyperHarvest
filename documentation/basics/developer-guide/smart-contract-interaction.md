# Smart Contract Interaction

To interact with the smart contracts:

1. Use Hardhat tasks for common operations:
   * Deploy vault: `npx hardhat deploy:vault --network arbitrum-sepolia`
   * Deposit: `npx hardhat deposit --amount 100 --network arbitrum-sepolia`
2. For custom interactions, use the `scripts/` directory as a starting point.
