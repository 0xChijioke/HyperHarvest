# HyperHarvest Vault

Our HyperHarvest contract follows the ERC4626 standard, which provides a standardized interface for yield-bearing vaults. This ensures compatibility with other DeFi protocols and makes it easier for developers to integrate with our platform.

Key features of our vault:

* Mints HH shares to represent user deposits
* Handles deposits and withdrawals of USDC
* Calculates and distributes yield to users based on their share of the total deposits
* Acts as a gateway for cross-chain communication
