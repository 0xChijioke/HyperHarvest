# Lit Protocol Integration

Lit Protocol plays a crucial role in our system:

1. **Encryption**: We use Lit to encrypt our strategy off-chain.
2. **Secure Execution**: Lit Actions provide a secure environment to decrypt and execute our strategy.
3. **Access Control**: We can specify conditions (e.g., caller must be our HyperHarvest contract) for strategy decryption.
