# ⛓️ Cross Chain Communication

We use Chainlink's CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to securely move funds and data between Arbitrum Sepolia and Optimism Sepolia. This allows us to:

1. Transfer USDC between chains when a more profitable opportunity is identified.
2. Share yield data across chains to make informed decisions.
3. Maintain a consistent view of the user's total deposits across all supported chains.
