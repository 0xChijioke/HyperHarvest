# Project Overview

Our Cross-Chain Yield Aggregator is an innovative DeFi solution designed to maximize the yield on USDC across multiple blockchain networks. By leveraging the power of cross-chain interoperability and private yield optimization strategies, we offer users a seamless way to earn the best possible returns on their USDC holdings.

The project currently operates on Arbitrum Sepolia and Optimism Sepolia testnets, with plans to expand to more networks in the future. We utilize the Aave protocol for generating yield and employ sophisticated strategies to determine the most profitable allocation of funds across chains and protocols.
