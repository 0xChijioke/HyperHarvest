# Withdrawing Funds

To withdraw your funds:

1. Go to the "Withdraw" section of the dashboard.
2. Enter the amount of HH shares you wish to redeem, or click "Max" to withdraw everything.
3. Click "Withdraw" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
4. You'll receive an XMTP notification once the withdrawal is processed.

Note: Depending on which chain your funds are currently on, there might be a short delay as they are bridged back to your preferred chain.
